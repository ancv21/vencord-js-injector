# vencord js injector
**This is for educational purposes only.**

This is a program written in C++ that allows direct JS injection into the Discord client abusing VenCord's packer.
It is ran before Discord launches, giving you access to everything, including the clients token.
I am not responsible for what you do with this.

The user must have Vencord installed for this to work, and the injected JS will disappear if they update their Vencord client.

# How to use this
1) Open the sln file
2) Change the variable of what code you want to run
3) Build it / Run it
4) Relaunch Discord :)
