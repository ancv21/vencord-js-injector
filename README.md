# vencord js injector
**This is for educational purposes only.**

This is a program written in C++ that allows direct JS injection into the Discord client abusing VenCord's packer.
It is ran before Discord launches, giving you access to everything, including the clients token.
I am not responsible for what you do with this.

The user must have Vencord installed for this to work, and the injected JS will disappear if they update their Vencord client.

# How to use this
1) Open the sln file
2) Change the variable of what code you want to run
3) Build it / Run it
4) Relaunch Discord :)

# Is this flagged?

No, this is unflagged/undetected by most Anti-Virus programs including Windows Defender. There are some flags, but they are linked mainly to false positives of other programs.
You can see the VirusTotal link to the built exe in this repo: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/643017a6de50b66924ae49d95b9b890e46f68053f86829417ee6e98365b800ba?nocache=1
